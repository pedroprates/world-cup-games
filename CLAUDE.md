# World Cup Games

Simple view for World Cup Games (for 2026 WC), adding next games and past scores. Simple, single page.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" ? "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" ? "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" ? "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] ? verify: [check]
2. [Step] ? verify: [check]
3. [Step] ? verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Human-in-the-loop Review

**Ask for full autonomy**

Whenever shipping a new feature, ask the user to review the change before commit.

- **Do not** commit a big feature change without asking the user to review it, or if explicitly said in the prompt to do the entire flow
- Be careful on commit new changes to branches, check if it's not the main branch. Never commit on `main` branch directly, ask user to create new branch
- **NEVER** do a `git add -a`, only add to staging environment files that you actively worked on.

Human-in-the-loop is important before commits, just avoid it when explicitly asked to do so.
